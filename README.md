# Replication package for: Price Floors and Employer Preferences: Evidence from a Minimum Wage Experiment

This document describes the organization of code, data, and software associated with the project.
The code for this replication package is at:

[https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git)


## Overview
Although this guide has details, the project is largely self-documenting in the sense that the key recipes for building the project are captured in code. 
The key pieces for replicating this project are: 

1. A [Makefile](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/master/writeup/Makefile) that gives recipes for how each figure, table, and called-out number is constructed in the paper.

1. A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that describes the system set-up needed with respect to computing resources and packages. 

### File organization

```
-writeup
-analysis
-computed_objects
-data_prep
```

The main writeup of the paper is in [`writeup/minimum wage.tex`]("writeup/).

The figures, tables, and parameter files (more on this later) are in `writeup/plots`, `writeup/tables` and `writeup/parameters`, respectively.

The code in [`analysis`]( https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/master/analysis ) writes files to these locations. 
In the repository, these locations are empty by design.
When the project is built, these locations are populated with the necessary files. 

### Conventions
Each main figure and table is generated by its own stand-alone R file in `analysis` folder. 
The output that file creates (e.g., a table or plot) has the same name as the R file, with the type of output prepended. 
For example, the plot `any_exper.pdf` in `writeup/plots` is created by `plot_any_exper.R` in `analysis.`

### Building the paper
The building of this paper is orchestrated by software called ``[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)''.
From the `writeup` folder at the command line, the user simply types `make minimum wage.pdf` which will then build the paper.

### A short make tutorial
A Makefile lists recipes for how a particular output used in the paper is constructed.
The Makefile entry for the any_exper.pdf figure looks like this: 
```
plots/any_exper.pdf: ../analysis/plot_any_exper.R
	cd ../analysis && Rscript plot_any_exper.R
```

Note that the target, or output is `plots/any_exper.pdf` 
After the colon is what this output depends on, code-wise, which is an R file in `analysis` called `plot_any_exper.R`.
The tabbed-in-line below is the recipe for how the target is actually constructed. 
In this case, it is just by running `Rscript` on `plot_any_exper.R.`

There is some code that is shared across multiple figures or tables. 
For example, `utilities_outcome_experimental_plots.R` has helper functions used in several plots.
To capture this dependency, there are entries in the Makefile that look like this: 

```
../analysis/plot_any_exper.R: ../analysis/utilities_outcome_experimental_plots.R
	touch ../analysis/plot_any_exper.R
```
The command `touch` here updates the timestamp of `analysis\plot_any_exper.R` which in turn 
would cause the recipe for `any_exper.pdf` to be re-run, as `plot_any_exper.R` is a dependency.

### Numbers called out in the writeup
There is also code that does not generate tables for figures, but instead generates "parameters."
These are numbers that are called out in the text but are generated automatically. 
For example, the `parameters/parameters.tex` file contains a line `\newcommand{\numTotal}{159,656}` that is related to the total allocation to the experiment.
If we look in `parameters.R` we see the corresponding code that creates this value.
```
addParam("\\numTotal", formatC(dim(df.mw.first)[1], big.mark = ","))
```

This `addParam` function comes from a personal R package called `JJHmisc` that is available on GitHub.

### Overall execution time on a modern laptop
From raw data to final PDF, it takes about 7 minutes to run. 

```
$ time make -B minimum_wage.pdf 

real	5m44.430s
user	7m28.013s
sys	4m42.827s
```

# Replication

## Getting the data and code
To replicate the file, you need the actual data. 
Assuming you have permission, you will modify the following `.env` file placed in the root directory.
```
REPLICATION_LOCATION=~
OWNER=johnjosephhorton
CODE_REPO=minimum_wage
DATA_PATH=../etl/transformed/
COMPUTED_OBJECTS_PATH=../computed_objects/
DATA_URL=<<redaced>>
PASSPHRASE=<<redacted>>
```
The `DATA_URL` is a URL to all the data used in the paper, encrypted with a passphrase. 
The `PASSPHRASE` is a long string I used to encrypt the data. 

```
#!/bin/bash

projectname=minimum_wage
codeurl=https://john_horton_public.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/minimum_wage.tar.gz
source .env

rm -rf /$REPLICATION_LOCATION/$projectname
echo "Moving replication location directory"
cd $REPLICATION_LOCATION
echo "Downloading code"
#git clone git@github.com:$OWNER/$CODE_REPO.git
wget $codeurl
tar -xvf $projectname.tar.gz  
cd $CODE_REPO
echo "Downloading data"
wget $DATA_URL
echo "Decrypting data"

sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/replication:/replication minimum_wage:v1 bash \

```

## Computational requirements
The computational requirements for reproducing this paper are minimal:
it can be run on a modern laptop in less than 10 minutes, using only open-source software.

The machine details are: 
System info:
- OS: "Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS"
- Processor:  11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11850H @ 2.50GHz, 16 cores
- Memory available: 31GB memory

The code was last run on 2024-01-03 15:16:41.

## Using Amazon Web Services (preferred)

There is a file, [start_machine.sh]( https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/master/start_machine.sh ) that will replicate the paper.
If you have [aws command line tools](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured, this script will: 

1. Generate a private  pair for you to use
1. Create an EC2 instance with sufficient RAM and storage
1. Copy over a replication script
1. Download the code & data used in the project
1. Install the necessary dependencies using docker (see Dockerfile)
1. Replicate the paper from scratch on the remote machine in a Docker container
1. Copy the completed PDF paper locally and open it up
1. Stop the instance (if desired) 

The replication script is here: 



## Using a local machine (next best - Dockerfile)

The best approach to replicating the paper is to use the following Dockerfile. 
```
FROM ubuntu:latest AS base
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install tzdata
RUN apt-get -y install pkg-config
RUN apt-get -y install r-recommended
RUN apt-get -y install make
RUN apt-get -y install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
RUN apt-get -y install build-essential
RUN apt-get -y install libxml2-dev
RUN apt-get -y install libssl-dev
RUN apt-get -y install libnlopt-dev
RUN apt-get -y install ghostscript

from base as latex
RUN apt-get -y install texlive-latex-base
RUN apt-get -y install texlive-latex-extra

from latex as rcran
#setup R configs
RUN echo "r <- getOption('repos'); r['CRAN'] <- 'http://cran.us.r-project.org'; options(repos = r);" > ~/.Rprofile
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('dotenv')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('cowplot')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('data.table')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('directlabels')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('dplyr')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('ggplot2')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('ggrepel')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('gridExtra')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('gt')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('lfe')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('lmtest')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('lubridate')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('magrittr')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('plyr')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('purrr')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('quantreg')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('sandwich')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('scales')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('stargazer')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('tidyr')"
RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('remotes')"

RUN Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github("johnjosephhorton/JJHmisc")'

from rcran as main

RUN mkdir minimum_wage
COPY . minimum_wage


```
The Linux dependencies are mostly either for LaTeX or dependencies for various R packages.

## Using a local machine without Docker - caveat replicator! 
If you do not want to use Docker, the parts of the Dockerfile can easily be turned into a script.
```
sed -n \
-e '/^FROM /d' \
-e '/^from /d' \
-e '/^COPY /d' \
-e '/^#.*$/!s/^RUN //p' Dockerfile > startup_script.sh
```

### Details

## List of tables and programs

Given the convention used here where each R file generates a single table or figure, the purpose of each file is mostly self-documenting.  For convenience, each figure or table in the paper is listed here with the file that creates it. It also includes a link to the location in the main body where that file lives.
