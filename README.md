# Replication package
## Price Floors and Employer Preferences: Evidence from a Minimum Wage Experiment
by John Horton

This document describes the organization of code, data, and software associated with the project.
The code for this replication package is at: [https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git)


## Overview
This project is largely self-documenting in the sense that the key recipes for building the project are captured in code. 
The key pieces for replicating this project are: 

1. A [Makefile](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/main/writeup/Makefile) that gives recipes for how each figure, table, and called-out number is constructed in the paper.

1. A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that describes the system set-up needed with respect to computing resources and packages. 

### File organization

The main directories are:
```
-writeup
-analysis
-computed_objects
-data_prep
```

The main writeup of the paper is in [`writeup/minimum wage.tex`](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/main/writeup/minimum_wage.tex).

The figures, tables, and parameter files (more on this later) are in `writeup/plots`, `writeup/tables` and `writeup/parameters`, respectively.

The code in [`analysis`]( https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/main/analysis ) writes files to these locations. 
In the git repository, these locations are empty by design.
When the project is built, these locations are populated with the necessary files. 

### Conventions
Each main figure and table is generated by its own stand-alone R file in `analysis` folder. 
The output that the file creates (e.g., a table or plot) has the same name as the R file, with the type of output prepended. 
For example, the plot `any_exper.pdf` in `writeup/plots` is created by `plot_any_exper.R` in `analysis.`

### Building the paper
The building of this paper is orchestrated by software called ``[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)''.
From the `writeup` folder at the command line, the user simply types `make minimum wage.pdf` which will then build the paper.

#### Docker approach

```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git
cd minimum_wage/writeup
cp ~/Downloads/.env . 
```

```bash
make docker
```

#### Non-Docker approach

```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage.git
cd minimum_wage
cp ~/Downloads/.env writeup
sudo ./system_update.sh

cd writeup
make minimum_wage.pdf
```




### A short make tutorial
A Makefile lists recipes for how a particular output used in the paper is constructed.
The Makefile entry for the any_exper.pdf figure looks like this: 

```Makefile
plots/cool_stuff.pdf: ../analysis/plot_cool_stuff.R  ../data/cool_data.csv
	cd ../analysis && Rscript plot_cool_stuff.R
```

Note that the target, or output is `plots/cool_stuff.pdf` 
After the colon is what this output depends on, code-wise, which is an R file in `analysis` called `plot_cool_stuff.R`.
The tabbed-in-line below is the recipe for how the target is constructed. 
In this case, it is just by running `Rscript` on `plot_cool_stuff.R.`

There is some code that is shared across multiple figures or tables in this repository. 
For example, `utilities_outcome_experimental_plots.R` has helper functions used in several plots.
To capture this dependency, there are entries in the Makefile that look like this: 

```Makefile
../analysis/plot_any_exper.R: ../analysis/utilities_outcome_experimental_plots.R
	touch ../analysis/plot_any_exper.R
```
The command `touch` here updates the timestamp of `analysis\plot_any_exper.R` which in turn 
would cause the recipe for `any_exper.pdf` to be re-run, as `plot_any_exper.R` is a dependency.

### Numbers called out in the writeup
There is also code that does not generate tables for figures, but instead generates "parameters."
These are numbers that are called out in the text but are generated automatically. 
For example, the `parameters/parameters.tex` file contains a line `\newcommand{\numTotal}{159,656}` that is related to the total allocation to the experiment.
If we look in `parameters.R` we see the corresponding code that creates this value.
```R
addParam("\\numTotal", formatC(dim(df.mw.first)[1], big.mark = ","))
```

This `addParam` function comes from a personal R package called `JJHmisc` that is available on GitHub.

# Replication

## Getting the data and code

A replicator will put a `.env` file in their `minimum_wage\writeup` folder. 
It will look like this:

```bash
GPG_PASSPHRASE='<password>'
project_name="minimum_wage"
DROPBOX_URL="<url of dropbox link hosting the data>"(base)
```

These values are used in a bash script that fetches the data, at [fetch_data.sh](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/main/fetch_data.sh)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source writeup/.env
wget -O remote_data.tar.gz.gpg $DROPBOX_URL
gpg --batch --passphrase "$GPG_PASSPHRASE" --decrypt remote_data.tar.gz.gpg > data.tar.gz
tar -xvf data.tar.gz
```

## Data-fetching entries in the Makefile

```Makefile
../remote_data.tar.gz.gpg:
	cd .. && ./fetch_data.sh
	
fetch-data: ../remote_data.tar.gz.gpg
	echo "Fetching data"
```

## Running the code 
The least error-prone 
```bash 
$ cd writeup 
$ make docker
```

## Description of programs/code

## Analytic files
The Makefile shows the mapping between each outcome in the paper and the analytic file that creates that outcome.

### License for Code

### Details

## List of tables and programs

Given the convention used here where each R file generates a single table or figure, the purpose of each file is mostly self-documenting.  For convenience, each figure or table in the paper is listed here with the file that creates it. It also includes a link to the location in the main body where that file lives. 
Please refer to the Makefile at [Makefile](https://www.github.com/johnjosephhorton/minimum_wage/blob/main/writeup/Makefile) for a list of each table and figure and the associated code and dependencies.

The provided code reproduces:

- [X] All numbers provided in the text of the paper
- [X] All tables and figures in the paper
- [X] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below.
