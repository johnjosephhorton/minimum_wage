 abstract = {We use longitudinal individual wage and employment data in France and the United States to investigate the effect of changes in the real minimum wage on an individual's employment status.  We find that movements in both French and American real minimum wages are associated with mild employment effects in general and very strong effects on workers employed at the minimum wage.  In the French case, a 1\% increase in the real minimum wage decreases the future employment probability of a man (respectively, a woman) currently employed at the minimum wage by 1.3\% (1.0\%).  In the United States, a decrease in the real minimum wage of 1\% increases the probability that a man (woman) employed at the minimum wage came from unemployment in the previous year by 0.4% (1.6%).},

Not surprisingly, the evidence indicates that low-wage workers are most strongly affected, while higher-wage workers are little affected. Workers who initially earn near the minimum wage experience wage gains. Nevertheless, their hours and employment decline, and the combined effect of these changes on earned income suggests adverse consequences, on net, for low-wage workers.},

We are able to test for substitution on observable and unobservable skill and demographic features and to measure the extent to which such substitution dissipates the benefits of a wage minimum for workers in affected firms. The results suggest substitution toward male, Latino, and black workers and workers possessing prior formal training. All are characteristics that generate a wage premium in this segment of the low-wage labor market in Los Angeles. Evidence for substitution based on unobservables is presented as well. The latter is revealed by the finding that the "before" wages of workers who are new to city contract work following the ordinance are significantly higher, conditional on observable characteristics, than the "before" wages of city contract workers who were hired preceding the ordinance. We estimate that the initial wage gain for workers is dissipated by roughly 27 percent through labor-labor substitution.},

 abstract = {Online markets reduce certain transaction costs related to global outsourcing. We focus on the role of verified work experience information in affecting online hiring decisions. Prior research shows that additional information about job applicants may disproportionately help or hinder disadvantaged populations. Using data from a major online contract labor platform, we find that contractors from less developed countries (LDCs) are disadvantaged relative to those from developed countries (DCs) in terms of their likelihood of being hired. However, we also find that although verified experience information increases the likelihood of being hired for all applicants, this effect is disproportionately large for LDC contractors. The LDC experience premium applies to other outcomes as well (wage bids, obtaining an interview, being shortlisted). Moreover, it is stronger for experienced employers, suggesting that learning is required to interpret this information. Finally, other platform tools (e.g., monitoring) partially substitute for the LDC experience premium; this provides additional support for the interpretation that the effect is due to information about experience rather than skills acquired from experience. We discuss implications for the geography of production and public policy.},

abstract = { This paper provides the first estimates of the
                  determinants of the duration of employer search in
                  the UK. We model duration until a vacancy is either
                  successfully filled or withdrawn from the
                  market. The econometric techniques deal with
                  multiple vacancies and unobserved heterogeneity
                  (dependent risks), using flexible and parametric
                  baseline hazards. The hazards to filling and
                  withdrawing exhibit negative and positive duration
                  dependence respectively, implying that the
                  conditional probability of successful employer
                  search decreases with duration. We also find that
                  nonmanual vacancies are less likely to fill,
                  consistent with there being skill shortages in the
                  sample period. Copyright (c) The London School of

 abstract = {Labor Market Intermediaries (LMIs) are entities or
                  institutions that interpose themselves between
                  workers and firms to facilitate, inform, or regulate
                  how workers are matched to firms, how work is
                  accomplished, and how conflicts are resolved. This
                  paper offers a conceptual foundation for analyzing
                  the market role played by these understudied
                  institutions, and to develop a qualitative and, in
                  some cases, quantitative sense of their significance
                  to market operation and welfare. Though
                  heterogeneous, I argue that LMIs share a common
                  function, which is to redress -- and in some cases
                  exploit -- a set of endemic departures of labor
                  market operation from the efficient neoclassical
                  benchmark. At a rudimentary level, LMIs such as
                  online job boards reduce search frictions by
                  aggregating and reselling disparate information at a
                  cost below which workers and firms could obtain
                  themselves. Beyond passively supplying information,
                  a set of LMIs forcibly redress adverse selection
                  problems in labor markets by compelling workers and
                  firms to reveal normally hidden credentials, such as
                  criminal background, academic standing, or financial
                  integrity. At their most forceful, LMIs such as
                  labor unions and centralized job matching
                  clearinghouses, resolve coordination and collective
                  action failures in markets by tightly controlling --
                  even monopolizing -- the process by which workers
                  and firms meet, match and negotiate. A unifying
                  observation of the analytic framework is that
                  participation in the activities of a given LMI are
                  typically voluntary for one side of the market and
                  compulsory for the other; workers cannot, for
                  example, elect to suppress their criminal records
                  and firms cannot opt out of collective bargaining. I
                  argue that the nature of participation in an LMI's
                  activities -- voluntary or compulsory, and for which
                  parties -- is dictated by the market imperfection
                  that it addresses and thus tells us much about its
                  economic function.},

                  strategies of the employer. In this article, they
                  discuss how characteristics of the employer or
                  conditions that the employer faces affect the
                  optimal search strategies and the probability of
                  filling a vacancy in each period. Semiparametric and
                  parametric methods are used to estimate hazard rates
                  of filling vacancies. The results suggest that, for
                  the given sample of vacancies, the general form of
                  the hazard function is nonmonotonic. Additionally,
                  the results suggest that those employers who have
                  advance notice of the vacancy may search longer than
                  those employers who do not. Copyright 1998 by

We then estimate an equilibrium search model. This model shows that a large scale role out of the activation program decreases welfare, while a standard partial microeconometric cost-benefit analysis would conclude the opposite.},

abstract ={This article reports the results from a randomized experiment designed to evaluate the direct and indirect (displacement) impacts of job placement assistance on the labor market outcomes of young, educated job seekers in France. We use a two-step design. In the first step, the proportions of job seekers to be assigned to treatment (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) were randomly drawn for each of the 235 labor markets (e.g., cities) participating in the experiment. Then, in each labor market, eligible job seekers were randomly assigned to the treatment, following this proportion. After eight months, eligible, unemployed youths who were assigned to the program were significantly more likely to have found a stable job than those who were not. But these gains are transitory, and they appear to have come partly at the expense of eligible workers who did not benefit from the program, particularly in labor markets where they compete mainly with other educated workers, and in weak labor markets. Overall, the program seems to have had very little net benefits. JEL Codes: J68, J64, C93.},

                  markets, in the process of designing marketplaces to
                  fix market failures. To work well, marketplaces have
                  to provide thickness, i.e. they need to attract a
                  large enough proportion of the potential
                  participants in the market; they have to overcome
                  the congestion that thickness can bring, by making
                  it possible to consider enough alternative
                  transactions to arrive at good ones; and they need
                  to make it safe and sufficiently simple to
                  participate in the market, as opposed to transacting
                  outside of the market, or having to engage in costly
                  and risky strategic behaviour. I will draw on recent
                  examples of market design ranging from labour
                  markets for doctors and new economists, to kidney
                  exchange, and school choice in New York City and
